		<p class="subsection-plaintext">The game has 5 pre-loaded songs packaged in the FMOD master bank.
		These songs can be selected by pressing on their thumbnail in the song select screen. 
		This prompts you with a beatmap selection box which dynamically loads any saved beatmap files.
		<br><br>
		After the selection and countdown, buttons play an animation based on the saved trigger value for that button.
		The time at which the user hits the button as it's flashing determines the type of hit (great/cool/miss). Hits are counted for end of song display.
		The animation values are found from a beatmap struct that contains a 2d float array for the hit timings.
		Every frame the 2d float array is iterated through and determines the current button state and its resulting visual state through accompanying variables.
		Each button is connected to a function that matches the hit button and checks if the button is within a period/has been hit before to determine if any 
		visual change occurs or if the input is ignored.
		<br><br>
		Beatmaps can be created by the user by pressing 'input mode' (red if active) and selecting the 
		song to make a beatmap for. The user gets a button grid identical to play mode and as the music plays can enter their own periods for animations.
		Upon hit the button turns yellow and blocks any further input until the period length is over.
		Many systems are recycled from the play mode for this functionality. At the end of the input, the user can choose to redo/save/play their new map.
		Save functionality is done using UE4's standard save slots.

		<h6 style="text-align:left;">Description:</h6>
		<p class="subsection-plaintext"> The game copies a fair bit of the atari classic 'asteroids' with a small few differences. 
		For gameplay description please check out the itch.io page.
		<br><br>
		This was my first attempt with Unity and C# and I had a little over two weeks to create for. 
		The competition organisers didn't provide any indication of when it would be or what we would use to create the game so when it came in the middle of working on
		compiler design coursework I left it for awhile and tried to finish what I was already working on at the time. 
		<br>
		The task was to use the existing basic project (which consisted of a magnet controllable with WASD that attracted or repelled spawning cubes).
		While I was very tempted to extend towards an original design, I felt that my inexperience with Unity was going to be a huge hurdle and so I decided it would
		be better to go with a non-roginal design and add on some original bits afterwards, I would discard the originality points to get as much as I could on working gameplay elements.
		<br><br>
		As luck would have it, Unity was a hell of a lot easier to get working with than Unreal. Spent about 5-6 days conceptualising the design around 'asteroids' from atari and
		watching/following through the Unity training days tutorials (space shooter/tanks/survival shooter/adventure game etc.). 
		The remaining week I was working from about 9am till midnight (left out the last hour on the last day becuase I vowed not to touch it anymore on the hour before submission).
		<br>
		While I got the majority of what I wanted to get in, there were a fair few setbacks:<br>
		</p>
		<ul style="font-size:12px;">
			<li>On the final day I wanted to get in some pickups that get attracted and picked up by the player(s) e.g. repair kits, but the day was spent bugfixing and special thanks
			  to my housemates who offered to bugtest for me and without them I don't think I would have even gotten the 8th place I got.<br>
			</li><li>Initially I had written a pause feature into the game, but as the project neared to a close I came to the conclusion that with the many systems that used coroutines
			  I would be unable to reliably pause the game without bugs (chalking this up to my lack of knowledge about Unity's coroutines), so I commented out the feature.<br>
			</li><li>Wanted to get in mouseless menu navigation (kb only) but the way I had structured by UI was less than optimal for the default UI navigator.<br>
			</li><li>Wanted to get in xbox 360 controller support, but time was just not on my side for this one. I considered it a low priority item, hoped to get it out on the last day :'(.<br>
		</ul>
		<br>

		I've only provided the Windows' executable on itch.io, but it can be built for OSX & Linux using the project files in the GitHub Repository.

		<h6 style="text-align:left;">Description:</h6>
		<p class="subsection-mediumtext">
		The reason this program came to be was because I was reading up on retro Sonic guides that went into detail on how slopes worked in Sonic the Hedgehog 1-3. 
		Slopes were pixel perfect and used outcoming rays from the Sonic avatar to determine if there was a block ahead, it it was below the ray height, Sonic would move onto it and otherwise push against it.
		For more into that, I suggest a read at:<a href="http://info.Sonicretro.org/Sonic_Physics_Guide"> http://info.Sonicretro.org/Sonic_Physics_Guide</a>
		<br>
		The idea was such that if a level was being created, the foreground on which Sonic could appear to move on could be used as a collision layer also generated from the pixels. 
		This may be a very expensive way of handling things in terms of collision systems even at the low resolutions the original Sonic games "ran" (:P) at. I haven't tested it as a collision system so I can't say how costly it is.
		<br><br>
		The program uses libpng to read the file header and decompress the pixel data, then copies the pixel data into heap allocated memory for each row of pixels (each pixel is 4x unsigned char for RGBA).
		A new text file is created based on the input image file name and iterates through each 4th value in the 2D array of pixel data to get just the alpha value for that pixel and sets the text value for that 
		pixel to 0 if equals 0 and 1 otherwise. The idea behind this being that Sonic can collide with the layer as long as its not entirely transparent. (In terms of adding colour to the background / foreground, think layered images 
		and just using this layer for the alpha-collisions).
		<br><br>
		The program also offers a functionality for splitting tilemaps into the square dimension images based on the input dimension per image. I've also had it take only RGBA images, but this was more of a tacked on functionality that would add
		to the main function of the program.

		<ol type="1" style="font-size:14px;">
			<li>Game loop uses gameprogrammingpatterns.com game loop style of variable rendering, fixed update where if the visible framerate lags behind, update steps in that loop iteration are increased to matches
			the average update-per-frame ratio (e.g. 100 physic steps per 60 renders), set to render using SFML graphics, can be replaced. Also set a fixed framerate of 60fps (did this by consuming time in the frame if its < 1/60).</li>
			<li>Controller code uses SFML's sf:Joystick class to check controllers' buttons and axis values. The problem with SFML's implementation is that it is reliant on the Windows Multimedia Library (preceeded by DirectInput) 
			and doesn't include out of the box vibration control or separate axis binding of the left and right triggers (on a default xbox360 wired the L2 and R2 are on the same axis as negative and positive).</li>
			<li>Collision code assumes that the screen is of a certain resolution and that the collision world is rebuilt every step. For each AABB that we chec collisions for we check what cells of the grid it occupies 
			and add to the list of occupied entities in that cell to the cell data, when the cell data is sorted afterwards, if we get two or more entities in the same cell we then pairwise sweep AABB check them. 
			One known negative of this collision system however is that if multiple collisions happen in a step and a collision causes the end position to be inside another object then it won't be resolved properly.</li>

		<p class="subsection-plaintext">
		This project involved using basic OpenGL 1 and C++ to create one of several tasks. I chose the 3D maze becuase it I believed it would be sufficiently challenging 
		and possibly extensible to another project at some point with its ability to have a top down map and a first person perspective. 
		Although I haven't made any moves thus far in that direction. 
		It would probabaly be best to learn modern OpenGL instead for that if I do end up taking that route. 
		<br>
		The program has hard coded walls and includes prevention of movement by the user into a wall if a movement moves into a wall.
		The solution line is also hard coded but involves using a vector as a stack-like structure where if the camera moves towards the line verticies it pops, 
		and otherwise pushes the previous camera position into the stack.
		<br><br>
		The turning 'animation' was done by utilising the Idle functionality where I set a flag to cue a custom Idle function that starts a turn and turns off the idle flag
		when two 45 degree turns are made. Camera turns are based on multiplying the camera by a rotation matrix. This project was completed in four days.

		This coursework required students to be sorted into random groups of five and prepare a solution to a common task.
		<br>
		We had to write the specification and requirement documents, create the application, present a final report on the document and the methodology used to create the application.
		In addition, we were required to do a Dragon's Den styled presentation to some judges for our software, outlining the key features of the application.
		<br><br>
		I used Powerpoint to create the intial design (at the time I did not know the pleasure of Paint.net and often played around with the image tools in powerpoint as a kid).
		Here was the result: <a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B3266QgrE-F1QUhmNlZrem5nTlE">GDrive (ppt)</a>, we were required to create a UI tool for navigating the data
		provided (Enron Email Corpus) and highlight communications between individuals in a selectable period. For this, we were not taught any UI tools previously 
		(exception of Web Development module in Year 1) and had to start from scratch. Thanks to the experience of having to work with the JavaFX without any real teaching or extensive textbooks
		I can appricate the fact that UI programming is just not easy (and it doesn't help when everyone around you seems to think it is).
		<br>
		<h6 style="text-align:left;">Notes:</h6>
		<ul style="font-size:14px;">
			<li>This is one of my least proud products of my time at Uni, but it also one that was made while under pressure, with a lack of knowledge of JavaFX 
			and a desire for fast results rather than code-reuse (of which I'm sure there is tonnes).</li>
			<li>Everything except Backend.java in the 'src' directory is my own work. For amusement or otherwise a lesson to myself, I have left it as it was when submitted. </li>
			<li>There may be some display bugs when run on Windows 10 (although this was back when Win10 was first released).</li>

		<p class="subsection-mediumtext">
		This program finds the FIRST, FOLLOW and FIRST+ sets that define what elements can be first encountered when reading an expression and what elements can follow it. FIRST+ is an extension of FOLLOW sets 
		where it takes into account whether or not an element that can follow that symbol can be reduced to nothing and transitively that element's FOLLOW set is now set union with the current symbol's FOLLOW set.
		The operation of this program may take awhile due to the way I have programmed the defining of undefined elements in expressions (to be explained in more detail below).
		Note: Terminal symbols are literals and do not expand. Non-terminal symbols are symbols that expand to expressions of other terminals or non-terminals.
		<br><br>
		The program operates in several stages:
		</p>
		<ol type="1" style="font-size:14px; margin-left:2%;">
			<li>Parse the input text files. - This defines an symbol and its productions, some production symbols may not be defined at the time of encounter.</li>
			<li>Update all production symbols with defintions.</li>
			<li>Compute FIRST sets - this is done recursively.</li>
			<li>Compute FOLLOW sets - this is done via looping through each symbol until a definition is found for a symbol, breaks if no update was done after two iterations.</li>
			<li>Compute FIRST+ sets - At this point we assume all symbols are defined and apply the FIRST+ rule.</li>
		</ol>
		<p class="subsection-mediumtext">
		Using looping to find the FOLLOW sets is much less efficient than using recursive, when I first wrote it I didn't put much thought into it. I had some concerns that doing it recusrsively may cause problems with cyclic defintions.
		While these are on point, and looping would break out if there were no changes and even a helpful message to say "Hey, your grammar has cyclic defintions", but ultimately when defining a grammar cycles should be removed anyways so 
		this concern was unnecessary. I could have changed it but ultimately I was more focused on correct results than speed so I never changed it.
