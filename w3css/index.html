		<p class="subsection-mediumtext">The game has 5 pre-loaded songs packaged in the FMOD master bank.
		These songs can be selected by pressing on their thumbnail in the song select screen. 
		This prompts you with a beatmap selection box which dynamically loads any saved beatmap files.
		<br><br>
		After the selection and countdown, buttons play an animation based on the saved trigger value for that button.
		The time at which the user hits the button as it's flashing determines the type of hit (great/cool/miss). Hits are counted for end of song display.
		The animation values are found from a beatmap struct that contains a 2d float array for the hit timings.
		Every frame the 2d float array is iterated through and determines the current button state and its resulting visual state through accompanying variables.
		Each button is connected to a function that matches the hit button and checks if the button is within a period/has been hit before to determine if any 
		visual change occurs or if the input is ignored.
		<br><br>
		Beatmaps can be created by the user by pressing 'input mode' (red if active) and selecting the 
		song to make a beatmap for. The user gets a button grid identical to play mode and as the music plays can enter their own periods for animations.
		Upon hit the button turns yellow and blocks any further input until the period length is over.
		Many systems are recycled from the play mode for this functionality. At the end of the input, the user can choose to redo/save/play their new map.
		Save functionality is done using UE4's standard save slots.

		<h5 style="text-align:left;"><b>Description:</b></h5>
		<p class="subsection-mediumtext"> The game copies a fair bit of the atari classic 'asteroids' with a small few differences. 
		For gameplay description please check out the itch.io page.
		<br><br>
		This was my first attempt with Unity and C# and I had a little over two weeks to create for. 
		The competition organisers didn't provide any indication of when it would be or what we would use to create the game so when it came in the middle of working on
		compiler design coursework I left it for awhile and tried to finish what I was already working on at the time. 
		<br>
		The task was to use the existing basic project (which consisted of a magnet controllable with WASD that attracted or repelled spawning cubes).
		While I was very tempted to extend towards an original design, I felt that my inexperience with Unity was going to be a huge hurdle and so I decided it would
		be better to go with a non-original design and add on some original bits afterwards, I would discard the originality points to get as much as I could on working gameplay elements.
		<br><br>
		As luck would have it, Unity was a hell of a lot easier to get working with than Unreal. Spent about 5-6 days conceptualising the design around 'asteroids' from atari and
		watching/following through the Unity training days tutorials (space shooter/tanks/survival shooter/adventure game etc.). 
		The remaining week I was working from about 9am till midnight (left out the last hour on the last day becuase I vowed not to touch it anymore on the hour before submission).
		<br>
		While I got the majority of what I wanted to get in, there were a fair few setbacks:<br>
		</p>
		<ul style="font-size:16px;">
			<li>On the final day I wanted to get in some pickups that get attracted and picked up by the player(s) e.g. repair kits, but the day was spent bugfixing and special thanks
			  to my housemates who offered to bugtest for me and without them I don't think I would have even gotten the 8th place I got.</li>
			<li>Initially I had written a pause feature into the game, but as the project neared to a close I came to the conclusion that with the many systems that used coroutines
			  I would be unable to reliably pause the game without bugs (chalking this up to my lack of knowledge about Unity's coroutines), so I commented out the feature.</li>
			<li>Wanted to get in mouseless menu navigation (kb only) but the way I had structured by UI was less than optimal for the default UI navigator.</li>
			<li>Wanted to get in xbox 360 controller support, but time was just not on my side for this one. I considered it a low priority item, hoped to get it out on the last day :'(.</li>
		</ul>
		<br>
		<h6 style="text-align:left;"><b>Notes:</b></h6>
		<p class="subsection-mediumtext">
		I've only provided the Windows' executable on itch.io, but it can be built for OSX & Linux using the project files in the GitHub Repository.

		<h5 style="text-align:left;"><b>Description:</b></h5>
		<p class="subsection-mediumtext">
		The reason this program came to be was because I was reading up on retro Sonic guides that went into detail on how slopes worked in Sonic the Hedgehog 1-3. 
		Slopes were pixel perfect and used outcoming rays from the Sonic avatar to determine if there was a block ahead, it it was below the ray height, Sonic would move onto it and otherwise push against it.
		For more into that, I suggest a read at:<a href="http://info.Sonicretro.org/Sonic_Physics_Guide"> http://info.Sonicretro.org/Sonic_Physics_Guide</a>
		<br>
		The idea was such that if a level was being created, the foreground on which Sonic could appear to move on could be used as a collision layer also generated from the pixels. 
		This may be a very expensive way of handling things in terms of collision systems even at the low resolutions the original Sonic games "ran" (:P) at. I haven't tested it as a collision system so I can't say how costly it is.
		<br><br>
		The program uses libpng to read the file header and decompress the pixel data, then copies the pixel data into heap allocated memory for each row of pixels (each pixel is 4x unsigned char for RGBA).
		A new text file is created based on the input image file name and iterates through each 4th value in the 2D array of pixel data to get just the alpha value for that pixel and sets the text value for that 
		pixel to 0 if equals 0 and 1 otherwise. The idea behind this being that Sonic can collide with the layer as long as its not entirely transparent. (In terms of adding colour to the background / foreground, think layered images 
		and just using this layer for the alpha-collisions).
		<br><br>
		The program also offers a functionality for splitting tilemaps into the square dimension images based on the input dimension per image. I've also had it take only RGBA images, but this was more of a tacked on functionality that would add
		to the main function of the program.
		</p>
		<ul style="font-size:16px">
			<li>This version takes in filename for target image and uses a custom exception class to indicate errors.</li>
			<li>As the purpose of this program was just to get alpha collision matrices, only RGBA png's will be excepted, otherwise an error is thrown.</li>
			<li>Input images for alpha output must be square in dimension.</li>

		<ol type="1" style="font-size:16px;">
			<li>Game loop uses gameprogrammingpatterns.com game loop style of variable rendering, fixed update where if the visible framerate lags behind, update steps in that loop iteration are increased to matches
			the average update-per-frame ratio (e.g. 100 physic steps per 60 renders), set to render using SFML graphics, can be replaced. Also set a fixed framerate of 60fps (did this by consuming time in the frame if its < 1/60).</li>
			<li>Controller code uses SFML's sf:Joystick class to check controllers' buttons and axis values. The problem with SFML's implementation is that it is reliant on the Windows Multimedia Library (preceeded by DirectInput) 
			and doesn't include out of the box vibration control or separate axis binding of the left and right triggers (on a default xbox360 wired the L2 and R2 are on the same axis as negative and positive).</li>
			<li>Collision code assumes that the screen is of a certain resolution and that the collision world is rebuilt every step. For each AABB that we check collisions for we check what cells of the grid it occupies 
			and add to the list of occupied entities in that cell to the cell data, when the cell data is sorted afterwards, if we get two or more entities in the same cell we then pairwise sweep AABB check them. 
			One known negative of this collision system however is that if multiple collisions happen in a step and a collision causes the end position to be inside another object then it won't be resolved properly.</li>

		from conception to vertical slice. Work on this project will cease in August 2018. It is currently in development using Visual Studio and UE4. As part of module requirements outlined by the course technical director, all submitted 
		material that makes up the game must be in C++ and not UE4's visual scripting solution (Blueprints).
		<br><br>
		Based on our provided Minimum-Viable-Product, the game is a 3D Metroidvania game with an overhead perspective. The game concept is about a woman exploring a lost civilisation with a mysterious relic/weapon she finds in the ruins.
		The main gameplay will be battling enemies with a combat system that is enhanced through skill upgrades found throughout the environment. 
		<br><br>
		On this project, I have been working as the liaison for the code team and as a gameplay programmer. As code liaison, I handle most of the PS4-related deployment issues and task assignment for the team. As gameplay programmer, I'm mainly 
		looking at camera related systems. We're looking at having an automatic camera that cannot be manually controlled by the player so I find it very challenging.
		<br><br>My contributions to the project this far:
		</p>
		<ul style="font-size:16px;">
			<li><b>Discord Bot for UE4-PS4 Remote Builds:</b> As we used a discord server as our team's main form of communication, I felt it would be appropriate/fun to try and automate the building process for PS4 using it.
				We have a decidated build machine setup for packaging PS4 builds and deploying them to the development kits. The bot does periodic builds within work hours and also provides for a manual call for a build request.
				The bot uses batch scripts I wrote to get latest from perforce, UE4's RunUAT.bat to package a PS4 build, and outputs formatted messages into the server automated-ps4-builds text channel with errors from RunUAT if it failed.
				<a target="_blank" href="images/DiscordBot.png">
					What it looks like
				</a>
			</li><br>
			<li><b>PS4 SDK & UE4 Setup for all team members:</b> Because of an issue with our university machine setups, we cannot use the Epic Launcher UE4 builds. Instead we are using the source version of 4.18 from Epic. 
				However, it wouldn't be appropriate for artists and designers to have to install visual studio and all the dependencies needed to make the source build so I made and distributed a binary version made from the source build.
				Some programmers also use it to prevent accidental rebuilds of the engine source code. I documented on our wiki all the steps needed to correctly install and confgure the PS4 SDK and UE4 as well as conducting a workshop 
				with the artists to get them all setup. 
			</li><br>
			<li><b>UE4 Perforce Source Control Setup:</b> UE4 generates many files that can be regenerated at any point during the project. I looked into setting up a .ignore similarily to git repositories and integrating perforce with UE4. 
				I documented on our wiki how to setup .ignores for the entire team (as perforce does it on a per-user basis rather than team) and had all programmers set up. I also documented and instructed artists on how to connect to perforce 
				with in the UE4 editor to update assets as they're changed/updated in editor.
			</li><br>
			<li><b>Camera Trigger Boxes:</b> As shown in the preview video above, I made two types that manipulate the character's attached camera directly. One is a time-based trigger, the other is a distance-based trigger. 
				The derived trigger box classes take curves that determine camera transformation over distance or time. Designers and replace the curve assets on the different instances to have different effects. Implementing this came about as a 
				stopgap of sorts for a more sophisticated camera system that I'm not sure we actually need based on the scope of our game and our current designs.
				<br><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KDrpmiFyRLs&feature=youtu.be">
					A designer using it in a level mockup.
				</a>
			</li><br>
			<li><b>Feasibility Reviews / Sprint Planning:</b> Whenever production have tasks or features on the backlog they would like to introduce on the sprint, I am the first port of call for feasibility estimates for programming effort required for a new feature. 
			If a designer wants to consider a new feature, I'm the person who negotiates the design against it's implementation cost and proposes alternatives or rejects the proposition altogether.
			</li>
		</ul>
		<p class="subsection-mediumtext">
		My future work will involve looking at different camera options for highlighting objects in the environment (Resident Evil styled cinematic camera or VFX) and dynamic camera focus / transformation when battling several enemies at once.

		This project was undertaken as part of Modules 1 & 2 of the GamerCamp postgraduate course at Birmingham City University. We prototyped the functionality in the first month and moved onto developing the feature 
		& content complete version of the game over the next 2 months leading up to winter. The team was made up of 4 artists, 3 designers & 2 programmers. The game is a linear single-screen platformer.
		<br><br>
		Cocos2D-x doesn't provide a user interface so most aspects of the game were coded such as In-Game Menus, asset loading, interfacing with an open-source level editor (OGMO) and physics.
		We decided to minimalistically use Box2D for physics where appropriate but made limited use of dynamic bodies and forces. Control is handled by Cocos2D's touch listeners which either have behaviour in the game through 
		Cocos' Button/Widgets or whole screen touches which are then checked for position within the screen to determine position-based callbacks.
		<br><br>
		Between the two of us we split tasks into different areas to prevent having to merge our changes on perforce all too often. I wrote UI, player movement, level loading through OGMO Editor XML files, platforms and the various types,
		wrote some changes to the OGMO editor as well to make it easier to use. In pre-production, we used a 
		<a href= "https://github.com/CBurberry/ConfigFileReader">
			text-based level loading class
		</a>
		 I wrote for quick prototyping so that we didn't have to recompile the project every time to test 
		code changes (included in code excerpts repo link above). This included loading some global variables and spawning lists for entities like platforms or collectables. When we moved to production we changed level/asset loading to the open-source OGMO editor.

		<p class="subsection-mediumtext">
		This project involved using basic OpenGL 1 and C++ to create one of several tasks. I chose the 3D maze becuase it I believed it would be sufficiently challenging 
		and possibly extensible to another project at some point with its ability to have a top down map and a first person perspective. 
		Although I haven't made any moves thus far in that direction. 
		It would probably be best to learn modern OpenGL instead for that if I do end up taking that route. 
		<br>
		The program has hard coded walls and includes prevention of movement by the user into a wall if a movement moves into a wall.
		The solution line is also hard coded but involves using a vector as a stack-like structure where if the camera moves towards the line verticies it pops, 
		and otherwise pushes the previous camera position into the stack.
		<br><br>
		The turning 'animation' was done by utilising the Idle functionality where I set a flag to cue a custom Idle function that starts a turn and turns off the idle flag
		when two 45 degree turns are made. Camera turns are based on multiplying the camera by a rotation matrix. This project was completed in four days.

		This coursework required students to be sorted into random groups of five and prepare a solution to a common task.
		<br>
		We had to write the specification and requirement documents, create the application, present a final report on the document and the methodology used to create the application.
		In addition, we were required to do a Dragon's Den styled presentation to some judges for our software, outlining the key features of the application.
		<br><br>
		I used Powerpoint to create the intial design (at the time I did not know the pleasure of Paint.net and often played around with the image tools in powerpoint as a kid).
		Here was the result: <a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B3266QgrE-F1QUhmNlZrem5nTlE">GDrive (ppt)</a>, we were required to create a UI tool for navigating the data
		provided (Enron Email Corpus) and highlight communications between individuals in a selectable period. For this, we were not taught any UI tools previously 
		(exception of Web Development module in Year 1) and had to start from scratch. Thanks to the experience of having to work with the JavaFX without any real teaching or extensive textbooks
		I can appricate the fact that UI programming is just not easy (and it doesn't help when everyone around you seems to think it is).

		<h5 style="text-align:left;"><b>Description:</b></h5>
		<p class="subsection-mediumtext">
		This program finds the FIRST, FOLLOW and FIRST+ sets that define what elements can be first encountered when reading an expression and what elements can follow it. FIRST+ is an extension of FOLLOW sets 
		where it takes into account whether or not an element that can follow that symbol can be reduced to nothing and transitively that element's FOLLOW set is now set union with the current symbol's FOLLOW set.
		The operation of this program may take awhile due to the way I have programmed the defining of undefined elements in expressions (to be explained in more detail below).
		Note: Terminal symbols are literals and do not expand. Non-terminal symbols are symbols that expand to expressions of other terminals or non-terminals.
		<br><br>
		The program operates in several stages:
		</p>
		<ol type="1" style="font-size:16px; margin-left:2%;">
			<li>Parse the input text files. - This defines an symbol and its productions, some production symbols may not be defined at the time of encounter.</li>
			<li>Update all production symbols with defintions.</li>
			<li>Compute FIRST sets - this is done recursively.</li>
			<li>Compute FOLLOW sets - this is done via looping through each symbol until a definition is found for a symbol, breaks if no update was done after two iterations.</li>
			<li>Compute FIRST+ sets - At this point we assume all symbols are defined and apply the FIRST+ rule.</li>
		</ol>
		<p class="subsection-mediumtext">
		Using looping to find the FOLLOW sets is much less efficient than using recursive, when I first wrote it I didn't put much thought into it. I had some concerns that doing it recusrsively may cause problems with cyclic defintions.
		While these are on point, and looping would break out if there were no changes and even a helpful message to say "Hey, your grammar has cyclic defintions", but ultimately when defining a grammar cycles should be removed anyways so 
		this concern was unnecessary. I could have changed it but ultimately I was more focused on correct results than speed so I never changed it.
