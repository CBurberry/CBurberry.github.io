		<h6 style="text-align:left;">Description:</h6>
		<p class="subsection-plaintext">The game has 5 pre-loaded songs packaged in the FMOD master bank.
		These songs can be selected by pressing on their thumbnail in the song select screen. 
		This prompts you with a beatmap selection box which dynamically loads any saved beatmap files.
		<br><br>
		After the selection and countdown, buttons play an animation based on the saved trigger value for that button.
		The time at which the user hits the button as it's flashing determines the type of hit (great/cool/miss). Hits are counted for end of song display.
		The animation values are found from a beatmap struct that contains a 2d float array for the hit timings.
		Every frame the 2d float array is iterated through and determines the current button state and its resulting visual state through accompanying variables.
		Each button is connected to a function that matches the hit button and checks if the button is within a period/has been hit before to determine if any 
		visual change occurs or if the input is ignored.
		<br><br>
		Beatmaps can be created by the user by pressing 'input mode' (red if active) and selecting the 
		song to make a beatmap for. The user gets a button grid identical to play mode and as the music plays can enter their own periods for animations.
		Upon hit the button turns yellow and blocks any further input until the period length is over.
		Many systems are recycled from the play mode for this functionality. At the end of the input, the user can choose to redo/save/play their new map.
		Save functionality is done using UE4's standard save slots.

		- The device used in the gameplay video is a chinese tablet dual core processor @1.6GHz and an ARM Mali 400MP (quad core), android 4.1, 1024x768 resolution.

		- This game is not complete, I aim to add dynamic user end music loading and beatmap loading through files in the near future as well as overall polish.

		<h6 style="text-align:left;">Description:</h6>
		<p class="subsection-plaintext"> The game copies a fair bit of the atari classic 'asteroids' with a small few differences. 
		For gameplay description please check out the itch.io page.
		<br><br>
		This was my first attempt with Unity and C# and I had a little over two weeks to create for. 
		The competition organisers didn't provide any indication of when it would be or what we would use to create the game so when it came in the middle of working on
		compiler design coursework I left it for awhile and tried to finish what I was already working on at the time. 
		<br>
		The task was to use the existing basic project (which consisted of a magnet controllable with WASD that attracted or repelled spawning cubes).
		While I was very tempted to extend towards an original design, I felt that my inexperience with Unity was going to be a huge hurdle and so I decided it would
		be better to go with a non-roginal design and add on some original bits afterwards, I would discard the originality points to get as much as I could on working gameplay elements.
		<br><br>
		As luck would have it, Unity was a hell of a lot easier to get working with than Unreal. Spent about 5-6 days conceptualising the design around 'asteroids' from atari and
		watching/following through the Unity training days tutorials (space shooter/tanks/survival shooter/adventure game etc.). 
		The remaining week I was working from about 9am till midnight (left out the last hour on the last day becuase I vowed not to touch it anymore on the hour before submission).
		<br>
		While I got the majority of what I wanted to get in, there were a fair few setbacks:<br>
		</p>
		<ul style="font-size:12px;">
			<li>On the final day I wanted to get in some pickups that get attracted and picked up by the player(s) e.g. repair kits, but the day was spent bugfixing and special thanks
			  to my housemates who offered to bugtest for me and without them I don't think I would have even gotten the 8th place I got.<br>
			</li><li>Initially I had written a pause feature into the game, but as the project neared to a close I came to the conclusion that with the many systems that used coroutines
			  I would be unable to reliably pause the game without bugs (chalking this up to my lack of knowledge about unity's coroutines), so I commented out the feature.<br>
			</li><li>Wanted to get in mouseless menu navigation (kb only) but the way I had structured by UI was less than optimal for the default UI navigator.<br>
			</li><li>Wanted to get in xbox 360 controller support, but time was just not on my side for this one. I considered it a low priority item, hoped to get it out on the last day :'(.<br>
		</ul>
		<br>
		<h6 style="text-align:left;">Notes:</h6>
		<p class="subsection-plaintext">
		I've only provided the windows' executable on itch.io, but it can be built for OSX & Linux using the project files in the github repository.

		<h6 style="text-align:left;">Description:</h6>
		<p class="subsection-plaintext">
		This project involved using basic OpenGL 1 and C++ to create one of several tasks. I chose the 3D maze becuase it I believed it would be sufficiently challenging 
		and possibly extensible to another project at some point with its ability to have a top down map and a first person perspective. 
		Although I haven't made any moves thus far in that direction. 
		It would probabaly be best to learn modern OpenGL instead for that if I do end up taking that route. 
		<br>
		The program has hard coded walls and includes prevention of movement by the user into a wall if a movement moves into a wall.
		The solution line is also hard coded but involves using a vector as a stack-like structure where if the camera moves towards the line verticies it pops, 
		and otherwise pushes the previous camera position into the stack.
		<br><br>
		The turning 'animation' was done by utilising the Idle functionality where I set a flag to cue a custom Idle function that starts a turn and turns off the idle flag
		when two 45 degree turns are made. Camera turns are based on multiplying the camera by a rotation matrix. This project was completed in four days.

		This coursework required students to be sorted into random groups of five and prepare a solution to a common task.
		<br>
		We had to write the specification and requirement documents, create the application, present a final report on the document and the methodology used to create the application.
		In addition, we were required to do a Dragon's Den styled presentation to some judges for our software, outlining the key features of the application.
		<br><br>
		I used Powerpoint to create the intial design (at the time I did not know the pleasure of Paint.net and often played around with the image tools in powerpoint as a kid).
		Here was the result: <a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B3266QgrE-F1QUhmNlZrem5nTlE">GDrive (ppt)</a>, we were required to create a UI tool for navigating the data
		provided (Enron Email Corpus) and highlight communications between individuals in a selectable period. For this, we were not taught any UI tools previously 
		(exception of Web Development module in Year 1) and had to start from scratch. Thanks to the experience of having to work with the JavaFX without any real teaching or extensive textbooks
		I can appricate the fact that UI programming is just not easy (and it doesn't help when everyone around you seems to think it is).
		<br><br>
		While I make my experience learning to program in JavaFX sound fun, the real fun (or lack thereof), was having team members who would:
		</p>
		<ul style="font-size:12px;">
			<li>A) Not turn up to meetings without reason</li>
			<li>B) Not do work while saying they were and forcing me to take it off their hands 2-3 days before a deadline.</li>
			<li>C) Leave any and all work to the very last minute.</li>
		</ul>
		<p class="subsection-plaintext">
		From this, I appriciate and respect team managers or developer leads the things they potentially have to deal with in additon to their own work just makes the role a lot more stressful
		than it needs to be.
		Ultimately I don't know was it my own inability as a project lead or the lack of authority or risk to those who were not responsible for overall progress of development.
		I hope this was just a case of a lack of experience on my part.

				<li>This is one of my least proud products of my time at Uni, but it also one that was made while under pressure, with a lack of knowledge of JavaFX 
				and a desire for fast results rather than code-reuse (of which I'm sure there is tonnes).</li>
				<li>Everything except Backend.java in the 'src' directory is my own work. For amusement or otherwise a lesson to myself, I have left it as it was when submitted. </li>
				<li>There may be some display bugs when run on Windows 10 (although this was back when Win10 was first released).</li>
